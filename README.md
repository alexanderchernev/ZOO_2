This project simulates a zoo management system using object-oriented programming concepts such as inheritance, abstract classes, and interfaces in C#.

## Features

- Implements a hierarchy of animal classes (Animal -> Mammal -> Carnivore, Omnivore, Herbivore).
- Uses abstract methods and properties in animal classes.
- Supports multiple interfaces (IEndangered, IDomestic, IWild) to manage animal status and behavior.
- Allows actions like hunting, foraging, grazing, and roaming for various animal types.
